Minimal Gecko_SDK
=================


Gecko_SDK was a Software Development Kit distributed by Silicon Labs for its EMF32 microcontrollers.
It used to be available at https://github.com/SiliconLabs/Gecko_SDK, but this repository was deleted.
It is no more distributed as a stand alone package and it is part of the Simplicity Studio IDE, distributed by Silicon Labs, as the message in the repository shows.


> **Gecko SDK**
> 
> The Gecko SDK Github repository has been discontinued. Download [Simplicity Studio](http://www.silabs.com/simplicity) and use the *Update Software* button in the *Launcher* view to access the latest and previous SDK versions. 


It can still be found somewhere at Silicon Labs Support Documents site, specifically at [Gecko.zip](http://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents/Software/Gecko_SDK.zip). It is a HUGE file, about 300 MBytes zipped and 2,4 GBytes after unzipping.

This is a stripped down version of Gecko_SDK containing the files needed to compile the projects at [Developing for the EFM32GG-STK3700 Development Board](https://github.com/hans-jorg/efm32gg-stk3700-gcc-cmsis). It is just 22 Mbytes in size and 2.2 Mbytes when zipped.
