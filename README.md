Minimal Gecko_SDK
=================

This is a stripped down version of Gecko_SDK containing the files needed to compile the projects at [Developing for the EFM32GG-STK3700 Development Board](https://github.com/hans-jorg/efm32gg-stk3700-gcc-cmsis). It is just 22 Mbytes in size and 2.2 Mbytes when zipped.

Gecko_SDK is a Software Development Kit distributed by Silicon Labs for its EMF32 microcontrollers. It is available at https://github.com/SiliconLabs/Gecko_SDK.

It is a HUGE file, about 300 MBytes zipped and 2,4 GBytes after unzipping.


**Note**

During a time it was no more distributed as a stand alone package and it could only be accessed as a part of the Simplicity Studio IDE, distributed by Silicon Lab. It was neccessary to download [Simplicity Studio](http://www.silabs.com/simplicity) and use the *Update Software* button in the *Launcher* view to access the latest and previous SDK versions. 

It was also possible to get an older version hidden in the conversions at the Silicon Labs site.
