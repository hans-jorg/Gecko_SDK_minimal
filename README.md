Minimal Gecko_SDK
=================

 Gecko_SDK is a Software Development Kit distributed by Silicon Labs for its EMF32 microcontrollers. It is available at https://github.com/SiliconLabs/Gecko_SDK. Gecko_SDK is HUGE, about 1.4 GBytes.

This is a stripped down version of Gecko_SDK containing the files needed to compile the projects at [Developing for the EFM32GG-STK3700 Development Board](https://github.com/hans-jorg/efm32gg-stk3700-gcc-cmsis). It contains just the CMSIS and the microcontroller specific header files. This minimal version is just 23 Mbytes big (2.2 Mbytes when zipped). 


**Note**

During a time Gecko_SDK was no more distributed as a stand alone package and it could only be accessed as a part of the Simplicity Studio IDE, distributed by Silicon Lab. It was neccessary to download [Simplicity Studio](http://www.silabs.com/simplicity). It is now possible to get it from [https://github.com/SiliconLabs/gecko_sdk](GitHub) but it is huge (1.4 GB).
